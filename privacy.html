      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">Effective date: 2025-09-01</p>
    </header>

    <section class="card">
      <p>This privacy policy applies to the LifeTicker app (hereinafter referred to as “Application”), developed by Christoph Bodynek (hereinafter referred to as “Service Provider”) as a Freemium service. This service is provided “AS IS”.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Data Storage and Processing</h2>
      <p>The Application stores your data locally on your device and, if enabled, synchronizes it securely via Apple’s iCloud private databases. The Service Provider does not operate own servers for LifeTicker and does not collect, transmit, or store your personally identifiable information on their own systems.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Permissions and Integrations</h2>
      <p>The Application may request access to the following iOS system services to provide specific features. Granting access is optional and can be changed at any time in iOS Settings:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> To deliver reminders you opt into for upcoming events.</li>
        <li><strong>Calendar:</strong> To allow optional import of existing calendar entries into the Application. Imported data remains on your device and/or in your private iCloud database.</li>
        <li><strong>Photos:</strong> To save generated images to your photo library or to share images via the iOS share sheet or URL schemes (e.g., Instagram). Data is passed directly to the chosen app; the Service Provider does not receive telemetry.</li>
        <li><strong>Apple Music:</strong> To search and play music via Apple’s frameworks. The Service Provider does not receive your Apple Music account information.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>Certain features rely on external services (e.g., Apple Music by Apple, Instagram by Meta). Your use of those services is governed by their respective terms and privacy policies, which apply independently of the Service Provider.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>No Tracking, No Ads</h2>
      <p>The Application does not use third-party advertising SDKs or cross-app tracking. No cookies or advertising identifiers are used by the Service Provider.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>The Application does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. If you believe such information has been shared with the Service Provider, please contact <a href="mailto:lifeticker@outlook.com">lifeticker@outlook.com</a> so that appropriate action can be taken.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>As no personal data is collected or stored by the Service Provider, risks are limited to the security provided by iOS and iCloud. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device and Apple ID. Avoid jailbreaking or rooting your device, as this can compromise system protections.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Changes</h2>
      <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Updates will be posted on this page.</p>
