    <section class="card">
      <p>These terms and conditions apply to the LifeTicker app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Christoph Bodynek (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Freemium service.</p>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>By downloading or utilizing the Application, you are automatically agreeing to the following terms. It is strongly advised that you thoroughly read and understand these terms prior to using the Application. Unauthorized copying, modification of the Application, any part of the Application, or our trademarks is strictly prohibited. Any attempts to extract the source code of the Application, translate the Application into other languages, or create derivative versions are not permitted. All trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to the Application remain the property of the Service Provider.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Use of the Application</h2>
      <p>The Service Provider is dedicated to ensuring that the Application is as beneficial and efficient as possible. As such, they reserve the right to modify the Application or charge for services at any time and for any reason. The Service Provider assures you that any charges for the Application or its services will be clearly communicated to you.</p>
      <p>The Application stores data locally on your device and, if enabled, synchronizes it securely via Apple’s iCloud private databases. The Service Provider does not collect, transmit, or store any Personally Identifiable Information on their own servers.</p>
      <p>It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your phone and access to the Application. The Service Provider strongly advises against jailbreaking or rooting your phone, which involves removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. Such actions could expose your phone to malware, viruses, malicious programs, compromise your phone's security features, and may result in the Application not functioning correctly or at all.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
      <p>The Application offers optional paid features via In-App Purchases and Subscriptions (including monthly, yearly, and Lifetime options). Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Payments and subscription management are handled solely by Apple through your App Store account. The Service Provider does not have access to your payment details.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>Certain features of the Application make use of third-party services:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Apple Music:</strong> used for searching and playing music, subject to Apple’s terms and privacy policy.</li>
        <li><strong>Instagram (Meta):</strong> used for sharing generated images, subject to Instagram’s terms and privacy policy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These services operate independently of the Service Provider. Your use of these services is governed by their own terms and privacy policies.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>Some functions of the Application require an active internet connection, which can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider. The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the Application does not function at full capacity due to lack of access to Wi-Fi or if you have exhausted your data allowance.</p>
      <p>If you are using the Application outside of a Wi-Fi area, please be aware that your mobile network provider’s agreement terms still apply. Consequently, you may incur charges from your mobile provider for data usage during the connection to the Application, or other third-party charges. By using the Application, you accept responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the Application outside of your home territory without disabling data roaming.</p>
      <p>It is also your responsibility to ensure that your device remains charged. If your device runs out of battery and you are unable to access the Service, the Service Provider cannot be held responsible.</p>
      <p>The Application is intended for personal use as a lifestyle and utility tool. It is not designed to provide professional advice of any kind. The Service Provider assumes no liability for any consequences resulting from reliance on the Application.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Updates and Termination</h2>
      <p>The Service Provider may wish to update the Application at some point. The Application is currently available as per the requirements for the operating system (and for any additional systems they decide to extend availability to) may change, and you will need to download updates if you want to continue using the Application. The Service Provider does not guarantee that it will always update the Application so that it is relevant to you and/or compatible with the particular operating system version installed on your device.</p>
      <p>However, you agree to always accept updates to the Application when offered to you. The Service Provider may also wish to cease providing the Application and may terminate its use at any time without providing termination notice to you. Unless they inform you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must cease using the Application, and (if necessary) delete it from your device.</p>
