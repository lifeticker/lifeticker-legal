    <section class="card">
      <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>By downloading or using the Application, you agree to these Terms. Please read them carefully before using the Application. Unauthorized copying, modification, translation, reverse engineering, or creating derivative works is prohibited.

    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>License</h2>
      <p>The Service Provider grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Application for personal, non-commercial purposes in accordance with these Terms. All rights not expressly granted remain with the Service Provider.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Use of the Application</h2>
      <p>The Service Provider may modify the Application or charge for services at any time. Any charges will be clearly communicated. The Application stores data locally on your device and, if enabled, synchronizes it securely via Apple’s iCloud private databases. The Service Provider does not collect, transmit, or store any Personally Identifiable Information on their own servers.</p>
      <p>You are responsible for keeping your device secure. Jailbreaking or rooting may compromise security and cause the Application to malfunction.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
      <p>The Application offers optional paid features via In-App Purchases and Subscriptions (including monthly, yearly, and Lifetime options). Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Payments and subscription management are handled solely by Apple through your App Store account. The Service Provider does not have access to your payment details.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>Certain features of the Application make use of third-party services:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Apple Music:</strong> used for searching and playing music, subject to Apple’s terms and privacy policy.</li>
        <li><strong>Instagram (Meta):</strong> used for sharing generated images, subject to Instagram’s terms and privacy policy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These services operate independently of the Service Provider. Your use of these services is governed by their own terms and privacy policies.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Apple Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>Apple Inc. is not responsible for the Application, its content, or any services offered through it. All purchases and subscriptions are handled by Apple via the App Store. The Service Provider is solely responsible for the Application, including support and maintenance.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>Some functions of the Application require an active internet connection, which can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider. The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the Application does not function due to lack of connectivity or exhausted data allowances.</p>
      <p>If you are using the Application outside of a Wi-Fi area, please be aware that your mobile network provider’s agreement terms still apply. Consequently, you may incur charges from your mobile provider for data usage during the connection to the Application, or other third-party charges. By using the Application, you accept responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the Application outside of your home territory without disabling data roaming.</p>
      <p>It is also your responsibility to ensure that your device remains charged. If your device runs out of battery and you are unable to access the Service, the Service Provider cannot be held responsible.</p>
      <p>The Application is intended for personal use as a lifestyle and utility tool. It is not designed to provide professional advice of any kind. The Service Provider assumes no liability for any consequences resulting from reliance on the Application.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Updates and Termination</h2>
      <p>The Service Provider may wish to update the Application at some point. The Application is currently available as per the requirements for the operating system (and for any additional systems they decide to extend availability to) may change, and you will need to download updates if you want to continue using the Application. The Service Provider does not guarantee that it will always update the Application so that it is relevant to you and/or compatible with the particular operating system version installed on your device.</p>
      <p>However, you agree to always accept updates to the Application when offered to you. The Service Provider may also wish to cease providing the Application and may terminate its use at any time without providing termination notice to you. Unless they inform you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must cease using the Application, and (if necessary) delete it from your device.</p>
